					</h2>
					 
					<p>Two random Android related tips:</p>

<p>1) If you&rsquo;re developing apps on less than common Android phones via Andriod Studio, like the One Plus One (my device), then using the <a href="https://www.londonappdeveloper.com/oneplus-one-adb-access-over-network-on-windows-10/">ADB network bridge</a> will save you having to figure out which set of drivers you&rsquo;d need to actually be able to connect to the phone via USB. It is cautioned against if you&rsquo;re on an untrusted network, and at least the One Plus One has you confirm that you want to create a debugging connection, but it does seem a bit handy.</p>

						<a class="title" href="/blog/pisc-git-mirror">PISC now has a Github Mirror </a> 
						
					</h2>
					 
					<p>A while ago, I decided to self-host the <a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com">PISC</a> repository using Fossil, mostly so that PISC could be easily self-hosted on hardware that I own, rather than relying on Github. Until now, this meant that to play with PISC, you had to either install fossil (which isn&rsquo;t hard, but is an extra step), or content yourself to a tarball/zip file.</p>

<p>As of this morning, there is now a Github based <a href="https://github.com/yumaikas/PISC-mirror">mirror repository</a>. While I don&rsquo;t intend to do my main development and documentation there, I will accept and work with issues and/or PRs there (such as I have time to do).</p>

						<a class="title" href="/blog/pisc-origin">My Programming Journey Part 2: Calculators led to Parsing led to Programming Languages </a> 
						
					</h2>
					 
					<p>Every programmer has a favorite toy problem or smallish program idea that they like to use to try out new tools. For quick testing of GUI tools, mine is a 4-function calculator. This fascination started at an early age, when I was programming QBASIC at the age of 14. I wrote one in 15 lines of code that prompted for the first number, operation and second number. When I moved on to <a href="http://basic.mindteq.com/index.php?i=70">Envelop Basic</a>, I created a GUI calculator with three text boxes, two inputs and one output, with a button for each of the 4 operations.</p>

<p>Then, as my family was traveling from Kansas to Florida in 2011, I was introduced to Petzold&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/">CODE</a>, and advised that C# would be a good language to pick up for finding jobs. One of my key discoveries working in BASIC during my teenage years was that I had to have a project in mind if I was going to get any programming really done. So I decided that to learn C#, I would build as much of a scientific calculator as I could figure out.</p>

					<p>A short reminder for those of us writing JS without libraries:</p>

<p>DOM attributes are a little strange from JS. When you iterate over them using the <code class="prettyprint">attributes</code> property, all the names come back completely lower cased.

					<p>I had the opportunity to visit my parents in Papua New Guinea this summer, and it was an awesome trip. It gave me a chance to clear my head and get away from the constant stream of information and distraction that is so baked into life as an American technologist. It also gave me a chance to get a perspective on what missionary life is like.</p>

<p>One example of life overseas being just straight hard work is the sheer amount of moving that is involved. First, you have to pack up your entire American life. Every. Single. Thing. All your books, clothes, cars, shoes, plates, food and everything has to be dealt with in some fashion.</p>

					<p>I am a programming polyglot. While I work by day in C#, I have wandered far and wide in my own time. Each language and surrounding ecosystem I&rsquo;ve tried has a different strengths and weaknesses*, but one stands out as disappointing to work with overall: Java.</p>

<p>Java, the language, is a little bit on the verbose side, and a little split-brained  in how it treats primitives vs classes, but it&rsquo;s very far north of tolerable, especially as generics and such have been added over the years. Java, the ecosystem, on the other hand, is a case study in making things more complicated and painful than it needs to be, especially on Windows.</p>

					<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn how to run more than one web application on a web server. I understand this often involves using nginx as a reverse proxy.

						<a class="title" href="/blog/RunningServicesOnDemand">Make sure you&#39;re able to run timer based services on demand </a> 
						
					</h2>
					 
					<p>My job has had me working on service applications that run on a timed interval. One aspect of debugging these services that was slowing me down was waiting for the service to get triggered. For the longest time, I compensated by having the service be in on a 10 second timeout, since it didn&rsquo;t take very long to run a sync. This still slowed me down though, and it made it easier to get sidetracked while waiting for the service to fire.</p>

<p>The solution didn&rsquo;t strike me for a good 3 months: Add a way to trigger the service on demand. It is a very obvious solution in retrospect. And it makes a lot of difference when debugging, as I can fire off the service as much as is needed to test for different states.</p>

					<p>There are stories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber ducky</a> (or teddy bear) problem solving, where the only thing that a person needs to do to solve a particular problem is articulate that problem to someone else, or in this case, something else. This leads to stories of engineers being able to solve their problems by explaining them to inanimate objects. When I explained this to my family, I suggested that I might want a rubby duck for Christmas, so that I would have something to explain my programming problems to.</p>

<p>So it was great fun to get a rubby duck for Christmas from my sister. She added a little story to it, projecting what Jules (the rubber duck) would be doing with me as I work on my programs. (She hadn’t read the wikipedia article that I linked to.)</p>

					<p>I have a very active mind. As a home schooler, I read around 1000 books (of various lengths) between learning to read and graduating. I also tend to have at least one program/board game/story idea percolating in the back of my mind. I started programming so that I could build a few of those ideas.</p>

<p>The creative process carries a great deal of intrinsic motivation. But there is also a mechanical side to programming that can’t be escaped. The mechanical side of programming is where a program gets its polish, but it can feel a bit gritty and tiresome at points. I find that it happens when performing ports to a familiar technology, or when writing yet another simple* SQL Query (YASSQ).</p>

Wars waged went back and forth over the RISK board, to the sound of much hilarity, fun, and explanation of rules.

The people you play with have a dramatic effect on your board gaming experience. </p>

<p>Since then I've played RISK several times, but over time I've realized that it is a game that is fundamentally drawn out. My relish for RISK has faded with experience. I've moved on to other games that have more intrinsic fun, like Dominion, Settlers of Catan and Race for the Galaxy. These games bring better pacing, balance, and variety to family game night.

<p>One of the things that I've been learning as a programmer is what well factored code looks like. There are several concerns that go into it, but one very important part of well factored code is the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The net result of DRY is that when you only have to write the unique elements of your code, removing repetitious noise. This helps you focus on actual differences in code, instead of trying to to filter the signal out of the noise.</p>

					<p>In the Kingdom of God, obedience is worth more than skill. God is more than able to make up for our deficiencies. These are some things that I've known to be true on a mind level, but lately God has worked in me to help sink into my heart. When we go on our own skill, the best we can do is be something that the world could have produced on it's own. Thus we have people that do "good" things, whether by temperament, a guilty conscience or civic duty. We end up reflecting ourselves, in all our human fallibility, and will disappoint those who see us. </p>

<p>But God has not called us to run on our own skill. He has called us to obey his calling. His calling is not always <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%204&version=NIV">comfortable</a>, nor is it always <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203&version=NIV">tame</a>. Regardless of how strange or difficult his calling is, he will provide for it to be fulfilled. When we are in tune with the Holy Spirit and obeying him, we don't run on the stuff of this world. The stuff of this world doesn't produce superhuman results.</p>
