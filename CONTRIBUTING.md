This repository is a mirror of [pisc.junglecoder.com](https://pisc.junglecoder.com), so if you'd like to get the best view of the project, that's where you should be able to find it.
I recommend opening an issue, or emailing me based on my profile before opening a PR. 

Right now I'm focusing on more tests, some basic performance improvements, and building up to a high quality IRC/Slack/Discord chat-bot frame work, hopefully one that can trade punches with Hubot. Contributions that focus in theses areas are more than welcome.
