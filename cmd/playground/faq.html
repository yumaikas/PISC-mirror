		<p>By <a href="https://junglecoder.com/blog/AboutMe">Andrew Owen</a></p>
		<p>The PISC playground is developed using gopherjs, HTML, Javascript, and PISC.</p>
		<p>
		Also, the source for PISC is currently the best source of documentation as to how it all works, once you've gotten past the PISC in Y minutes.
		This isn't an ideal or desired sitation, but it is the way it is for now. I'd recommend taking a look at 
		<a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/home/apps/fossil/PISC.fossil/dir?ci=tip">interpreter.go</a> if you want to understand the core of this, and 
		<a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/home/apps/fossil/PISC.fossil/dir?ci=tip">loops.go</a>, <a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/home/apps/fossil/PISC.fossil/dir?ci=tip">locals.go</a> and <a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/home/apps/fossil/PISC.fossil/dir?ci=tip">dicts.go</a> if you want some starting points.

		<p><sup>Yes, those are all links the same directory. You'll figure it out. :)</sup></p>
