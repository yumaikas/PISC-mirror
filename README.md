# PISC
Position Independent Source Code. A small, stack-based, concatenative language.

This is currently a small side project to see how far a small stack-based scripting language can go in spare time. Inspired by Factor (80%), Forth (5%) and Python (5%) and Tcl (5%) (not 100% inspired yet.)
Plans are currently for an interperated language.

.pisc is the file extension.
